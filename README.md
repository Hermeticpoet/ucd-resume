# Online Resume: Personal Webpage

This is my first *mini-project*. An online resume with attached, downloadable .pdf copy of C.V.

## The Goal

To create a simple online presence where potential employers or collaborators can view my profile, background and skillset.
No new ground is being broken here. I am keeping it conventional and aesthetic with basic functionality.

## The Presentation

I used basic colour theory in creating my palette for this site. Two of my favourite colours are Purple and Green, 
therefore, I opted for the triadic colour scheme that includes green, purple and orange.
