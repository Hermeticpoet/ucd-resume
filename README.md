# Online Resume: Personal Webpage

This is my first *mini-project*. An online resume with attached, downloadable .pdf copy of C.V.

## The Goal

To create a simple online presence where potential employers or collaborators can view my profile, background and skillset.
No new ground is being broken here. I am keeping it conventional and aesthetic with basic functionality.

## The Presentation

Basic colour theory was used in creating my palette and as Purple and Green are two of my favourite colours I have based the scheme around them.
